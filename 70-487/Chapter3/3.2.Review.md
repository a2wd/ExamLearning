# Chapter 3

Designing and implementing WCF services

## Part 1

Create a WCF service

### Thought experiment

1. When using methods in a WCF service that you don't want publicly exposed you make them private methods, and importantly omit the `OperationContract` attribute, preferably from the interface than the implementation.

2. You could handle enumeration types with `EnumMember` and complex types with `DataMember` attributes.

3. Exceptions can be handled with the `FaultContract` and decorated with further attributes to handle extra information - `FaultMessage`, `FaultCode`.

### Quiz

* 1.D You could use a `FaultContract(IndexOutOfRangeException)` attribute for range exceptions in a WCF service.
* 2.A/C WCF services must have an interface and either interface or implementation must have `ServiceContract`/`OperationContract` attributes.
* 3.A/B to add a new service, you could add it to the interface and decorate it with `OperationContract`.
