# Chapter 3

Designing and implementing WCF services

## Part 1

Create a WCF service

### Thought experiment

1. When using methods in a WCF service that you don't want publicly exposed you make them private methods, and importantly omit the `OperationContract` attribute, preferably from the interface than the implementation.

**Correct**

2. You could handle enumeration types with `EnumMember` and complex types with `DataMember` attributes.

**Correct**

3. Exceptions can be handled with the `FaultContract` and decorated with further attributes to handle extra information - `FaultMessage`, `FaultCode`.

**Correct**

### Quiz

* 1.D You could use a `FaultContract(IndexOutOfRangeException)` attribute for range exceptions in a WCF service. **A - fault contract needs to be used in conjunction with the type**
* 2.A/C WCF services must have an interface and either interface or implementation must have `ServiceContract`/`OperationContract` attributes. **C - not A because the contract doesn't necessarily have to be specified via the interface**
* 3.A/B to add a new service, you could add it to the interface and decorate it with `OperationContract`. **//correct**


## Part 2

Configure WCF services by using configuration settings

### Thought experiment

1. If there is a lot of growth expected, it could be the case that code will need to change to accomodate this, however it would still be preferrable to stick to configuration files to manage changes as much as possible because they can be changed without needing to redeploy the service.

**Correct**

2.  You could configure bindings that would be most used such as httpBinding or httpsBinding.

**Correct, it is better to not hard-code values**

### Quiz

1.A/D To configure a new service you must specify the service and contract. **//correct**
2.A/B/C/D All aspects of a service can be handled through configuration **//correct**
3.D It is not possible to add new method definitions in configuration files. **//correct**


## Part 3

Configure WCF services

### Thought experiment

1. Generally it is best to use a configuration based approach even when the requirements of a service are unlikely to change, as it doesn't hinder or stop you from doing anything differently.

**Correct**

2. If you defined everything imperatively it would make it harder to implement changes to the service.

**Correct**

3. If you defined an entire service in configuration it would not hinder development.

**Correct**

### Quiz

* 1.B When using only .net clients, for speed, you would be best served with a BinaryMessageEncodingBindingElement **//D an invalid operation exception**
* 2.D You can't define the `ServiceOperation` on both the implementation and interface **//Correct**
* 3.A/C/D Tcp-, Http- and MTOM- TransportBindingElement(s) are all valid binding elements. **//A/C - D is not a specific binding for CustomBinding**


## Part 4

Secure a WCF service

### Thought experiment

1. For secure information, it would be wise to choose both message and transport level security.

**Correct**

2. For less sensetive information, it would still be wise to implement full security.

**Correct**

3. Certificate-based security is a good option at all times.

**Correct, however if it is uneeded the overhead to setting it up may go against it**

### Quiz

* 1.B Using a https binding would improve security **//A,B,C - Protocol Mappings and HTTPS would also help**
* 2.A/B/C In WCF you can implement both message and transport-level security **//Correct**
* 3.A/B/D for a NetTcpBinding with NTLM auth, you need to set the binding, clientCredentialType and a security mode value. **//Correct**


## Part 5

Consume WCF services

### Thought experiment

1. If adding a client on different OS versions, you could use either Svcutil or Add Service Reference as they offer the same options

**Correct, though Add Service Reference can't be scripted and is dependent on Visual Studio**

2. It would be preferable not to support platform-specific features like generics or arrays.

**Arrays are not platform specific, though generics are**

3. Apart from this, it would be good to consider any other platform dependent features.

**Yes, and LINQ was only introduced in .net 3.0 though Svcutil.ex can generate specific code for you**

### Quiz

* 1.B/C/D You could build a client side proxy any of three ways **//Correct**
* 2.B You could use advaced service reference options to support different types **//Correct**
* 3.A/B/C Svcutil validates code, downloads metadata and generates serialisation code. **//Correct**


## Part 6

Version a WCF service

### Thought experiment

1. You can avoid breaking changes by adding new contracts rather than modifying existing ones.

**Correct, though discussion focused on mitigating effects of breaking changes and planning for them**

2. If you have to implement breaking changes you could implement them by revising the major version number.

**Correct, though discussion focussed on communicating breaking changes to customers and planning well in advance**

### Quiz

**Errata - q.3 is referred to as q2 is referred to as q1 and q1 is omitted**

* 1.B Adding extra methods is not a breaking change **(ommitted from answers)**
* 2.C Methods that don't implement OperationContract attributes don't cause breaking changes **(q1 in answers) A/C - contract changes are also breaking changes**
* 3.A/B/D you can use strict or lax versioning in WCF **//correct**


## Part 7

Create and configure WCF on Azure

### Thought experiment

1. Whether or not a customer opts to use the cloud or a hybrid solution depends on their comfort with storing sensetive data externally. They could opt for the hybrid solution for instance and expose certain data where required.

**correct**

2. Service bus relay can be used here to transmit sensetive data from the on-prem servers to the clients in the cloud. This could allow the data to be stored internally but made accessible externally too.

**correct**

### Quiz

* 1.A/C/D When configuring a service you need the namespace, service host and default key. **//A,D - C the ServiceHost can't be configured in the portal**
* 2.C You need the owner and key to set up a secret token. **//correct*
* 3.A/B/C/D You need a namespace, service path, owner and key to connect a client to the service bus. **//correct**


## Part 8

Implement messaging patterns

### Thought experiment

1. Logging calls in a chatty application would be a good candidate for a OneWay messaging pattern.

**correct**

2. You wouldn't want to employ duplex comms for all features because of the required open connections.

**correct, though specifically the connection overheads**

### Quiz

* 1.A OneWay methods can't return any parameters **//correct**
* 2.A/D To allow streaming, the binding must allow streaming. **//A,D - http is stateless, C - the service must be able to callback**
* 3.B To implement real time comms, you must support duplexing. **//correct**


## Part 9

Host and manage services

### Thought experiment

1. When dealing with a heavy demand from clients and with a team knowledgeable in ASP.net, you might want to consider WPF via a self-hosted approach, though for large scale and applications requiring TCP, MSMQ and HTTP, you might benefit from training into using WAS.

**Self hosting would be a bad choice**

2. IIS wouldn't be suitable because it only supports HTTP bindings.

**correct**

3. Many factors shift the equation from one host to another such as available bindings, requirements for up-time and skills already present in-house, to name a few.

**correct**

### Quiz

* 1.C The InstanceContextMode PerCall setting causes a new instance of a service for each request. **//correct**
* 2.B/C/D There are many options for hosting WCF services, from IIS to console apps. **Also A - a hosted service has an appDomain entry point**
* 3.A/B/C for a service to be discoverable, it needs to have a discovery endpoint. **//A,B - not C as although a ServiceBehaviour definition is useful, it's not required**
