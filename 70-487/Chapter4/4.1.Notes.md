# Chapter 4 - Creating and consuming web API based services

## Part 1 - Design a Web API

WebAPI is HTTP so a lot of configuration is already taken care of.

### Choosing appropriate methods

It's important to use the right REST verb and the correct status code.

Methods:

* Delete - delete
* Get - read
* Put - update
* Post - create
* Head - retrieves the message headers
* Patch - update (partial message only identifiers and modified fields are sent)
* Options - request for info about comms options available

With **HttpGet**, you may have a scheme such as the following and you can check inside the method for whether the item exists and throw a HttpResponseException with HttpStatusCode of NotFound if necessary.

`/api/something/key` or `/api/something?attribute=val`

**HttpDelete**: it's a good idea to prefix delete operations for clarity. This could return 200 (OK), 202 (Accepted, pending) or 204 (No response - a void return on the method will cause this).

**HttpPost** is always used to create new items. HTTP 1.1 states you return 201 (created) when creating items but this doesn't happen automatically. You can return a value from a POST method to indicate success.

For example:

```
[HttpPost]
public HttpResponseMessage PostAccount(Account account)
{
 HttpResponseMessage response = Request.CreateResponse<Account>(HttpStatusCode.Created, account);
 string newUri = Url.Link("NamedApi", new { accountId = account.AccountId });
 response.Headers.Location = new Uri(newUri);
 return response;
}
```

**HttpPut** is straightforward, methods can be labelled with `[HttpPut]` and should have Put in the name.

**It's a good idea to put simple parameters in the request route but save complex types for the request body**

>> For the exam, the CRUD **update** is represented by the WebAPI **put**.

### Defining resources with actions

In VisualStudio, you would use the WebAPI project. It is usually a good idea to build the model first.

The model is a regular .net class with public properties. The default constructor must be public.

The controller must inherit `ApiController` and defines the actions/action methods that can be used.

For instance you may have an `AccountController` with a `GetAccounts` class and a `SearchAccounts` class. That respectively return JSON or XML serialised data of the relevant accounts.

When a request doesn't match available data you can return a HttpResponseException with a HttpStatusCode or a HttpResponseMessage.

**Browser functionality/support**: when testing, different browsers will have different behaviour due to sending different headers. For instance, in IE10: `Accept: text/html, application/xhtml+xml, */*`

### Routing

The routing is defined in the routing table which implements `System.Web.Http.Routing.IHttpRouting`.

```
config.Routes.MapHttpRoute(
 name: "DefaultApi",
 routeTemplate: "api/{controller}/{id}",
 defaults: new { id = RouteParameter.Optional }
 );
```

The default WebAPI routing works for **GET**, **POST**, **PUT** and **DELETE**. If using convention, you don't need to decorate a method (ie, with `[HttpPut]`).

**Use `System.Web.Http` for `ApiController` and `System.Web.Mvc` for `MvcController`**.

The `[AcceptVerbs(string[] verbs)]` atrribute allows you to specify multiple verbs for a method.

**ActionName**: you can specify the action in the route: `routeTemplate: "api/{controller}/{action}/{id}"` or in an attribute: `[ActionName("myAction")]`.

You can also specify public methods (which would automatically be exposed as actions) to not be actions with the `[NonAction]` attribute.

**Response formats** depend on the browser's sent headers, though this can be specified if using Ajax. You can serialise the data with different formats using a `MediaTypeFormatter` or `BufferedMediaTypeFormatter`.

### Planning for async

WebAPI calls run on a thread each - so too many queues and long running operations can cause a server slow/melt-down.

__Async calls are a good fit for IO-bound tasks__ (if CPU-bound, say by intensive processing tasks, then there is little to no benefit).

The folllowing illustrates converting a sync method to async:

```
public string Get()
{
 WebClient webClient = new WebClient();
 string result = webClient.DownloadString("http://microsoft.com");
 return result;
}

public async Task<string> Get()
{
 WebClient webClient = new WebClient();
 string result = await webClient.DownloadStringTaskAsync("http://microsoft.com");

 return result;
}
```


## Part 2 - Implement a WebAPI

It is useful to wire up a page with JavaScript to enable communication with the api via Ajax calls.

The HttpRequest header allows you to specify what content is returned via *content negotiation*, valid attributes are:

* Accept
* Accept-Charset
* Accept-Encoding
* Accept-Language

An example request-response might look like this:

```
GET http://localhost:53366/data/Customer/FindCustomers?lastName=r HTTP/1.1
X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest
Accept: application/json, text/javascript, */*; q=0.01
Referer: http://localhost:53366/
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 10.0; Windows NT 6.2; WOW64; Trident/6.0)
Host: localhost:53366
DNT: 1
Connection: Keep-Alive
```

with the server responding:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Cache-Control: no-cache
Pragma: no-cache
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Expires: -1
Server: Microsoft-IIS/8.0
X-AspNet-Version: 4.0.30319
X-SourceFiles: =?UTF-8?B?QzpcUHJvamVjdHNcTXlTb2x1dGlvblxNeVdlYkFwaVxkYXRhXEN1c3RvbWVyXEZ
pbmRDdXN0b21lcnM=?=
X-Powered-By: ASP.NET
Date: Mon, 15 Jul 2013 15:52:20 GMT
Content-Length: 290
[{"CustomerId":4,"AccountId":2,"FirstName":"Captain","LastName":"America"},
{"CustomerId":8,"AccountId":3,"FirstName":"Ham","LastName":"Burgler"},
{"CustomerId":11,"AccountId":4,"FirstName":"Betty","LastName":"Rubble"},
{"CustomerId":12,"AccountId":4,"FirstName":"Barney","LastName":"Rubble"}]
```

Content negotiation happens by:

1. Request received by server, server gets instance of IContentNegotiator from the HttpConfiguration
2. The config also includes a formatters collection
3. The negotiate method is called, taking the object to serialise, the formatters and the Request
4. The Negotiate method returns the formatter and the media type for the response
	- Or, null if no formatter is found (client gets 406, Not Acceptable)

### Binding

Usually complex types (custom classes) are sent in the message body and simple types like int, bool are sent in the query.

You can add a `[FromUri]` attribute to a parameter to cause it to render complex types:

```
public class Person
{
 public string FirstName { get; set; }
 public string LastName { get; set; }
}

public HttpResponseMessage Get([FromUri] Person person) { /* implementation */}

http://localhost/api/Persons/?FirstName=John&LastName=Doe
```

You can do the inverse with `[FromBody]` causing it to be taken from the message body.

### HttpMessageHandler - process requests & responses

You can add handlers to the pipeline by inheriting DelegatingHandler:

```
public class LoggingMessageHandler: DelegatingHandler
{
 protected async override Task<HttpResponseMessage> SendAsync(HttpRequestMessage request, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
 {
 Debug.WriteLine("Process request");
 var response = await base.SendAsync(request, cancellationToken);
 Debug.WriteLine("Process response");
 return response;
 }
}

...

config.MessageHandlers.Add(new LoggingMessageHandler());
```

You can also cancel calling other handlers, for instance to return early.

You can also add a handler locally to one action with:

```
config.Routes.MapHttpRoute(
 name: "LoggingRoute",
 routeTemplate: "api/sensitive/{id}",
 defaults: new { controller = "sensitive" id = RouteParameter.Optional },
 constraints: null,
 handler: new LoggingMessageHandler()
 );
```

### Dependency injection

When working with dependency injection (to deal with dependency inversion, the D in SOLID), you need to use the `IDependencyResolver` class to implement this in WebAPI:

```
public class ResolveController : IDependencyResolver
{
 public object GetService(Type serviceType)
 {
 return serviceType == typeof(ContentController) ?
 new ContentController(new WebClientContentRepository()) : null;
 }
 public IEnumerable<object> GetServices(Type serviceType)
 {
 return new List<object>();
 }
 public IDependencyScope BeginScope()
 {
 return this;
 }
 public void Dispose() { }
}
```

You also need to configure the resolver: `config.DependencyResolver = new ResolveController();`

There's also the `Unity.WebApi` nuget package that helps do this for you. It installs a bootstrapper.cs which you need to call from Global.asax and you can register dependencies in it:

`container.RegisterType<IContentRepository, WebClientContentRepository>();`

### Action filters/exception filters

By inheriting from `ActionFilterAttribute`, you can override the pipeline handling and make an attribute that forces behaviour, for instance responding with XML:

```
public class XmlOutputAttribute : ActionFilterAttribute
{
public override void OnActionExecuted(HttpActionExecutedContextactionExecutedContext)
{
ObjectContent content = actionExecutedContext.Response.Content as ObjectContent;
var value = content.Value;
Type targetType = actionExecutedContext.Response.Content.
GetType().GetGenericArguments()[0];
var httpResponseMessage = new HttpResponseMessage
{
StatusCode = HttpStatusCode.OK,
RequestMessage = actionExecutedContext.Request,
Content = new ObjectContent(targetType, value,
newXmlMediaTypeFormatter(), (string)null)
};
actionExecutedContext.Response = httpResponseMessage;
base.OnActionExecuted(actionExecutedContext);
}
}
```

Exception filters work similarly, but are triggered on errors and can log, return nice messages etc. They inherit `ExceptionFilterAttribute`.

Filters can be added to a method, class or globally on `HttpConfiguration.Filters`.

**Async** actions should be used for IO-bound operations.

### Streaming actions

Can be made with the `PushStreamContent` class:

```
namespace StreamingApp.Controllers
{
public class PushContentController : ApiController
{
private static readonly Lazy<Timer> _timer =
new Lazy<Timer>(() => new Timer(TimerCallback, null, 0, 1000));
private static readonly ConcurrentDictionary<StreamWriter, StreamWriter>
_outputs = new ConcurrentDictionary<StreamWriter, StreamWriter>();
public HttpResponseMessage GetUpdates(HttpRequestMessage request)
{
Timer t = _timer.Value;
request.Headers.AcceptEncoding.Clear();
HttpResponseMessage response = request.CreateResponse();
response.Content = new PushStreamContent(OnStreamAvailable, "text/plain");
return response;
}
private static void OnStreamAvailable(Stream stream, HttpContent headers,
TransportContext context)
{
StreamWriter sWriter = new StreamWriter(stream);
_outputs.TryAdd(sWriter, sWriter);
}
private static void TimerCallback(object state)
{
foreach (var kvp in _outputs.ToArray())
{
try
{
kvp.Value.Write(DateTime.Now);
kvp.Value.Flush();
}
catch
{
StreamWriter sWriter;
_outputs.TryRemove(kvp.Value, out sWriter);
}
}
}
}
}
```

## Part 3 - Secure a Web api

You might want to **Authenticate** users to a service but passwords can still be shared. There are more tools that can be used though.

**Authorisation** can be used to give authenticated users access to different content/actions.

### basicHttpAuthentication

This has good support, is quite easy to implement and is simple and native to IIS, but is vulnerable to XSRF, sends credentials as plaintext and has no way to explicitly log out.

A server will respond with `WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm="Realm Name"` to indicate basic authentication is supported. The client might respond with the **base-64 encoded: `Authorization: Basic Sm9oblFQdWJsaWM6ISpNeVBhNTV3MHJkKiE=` to authenticate.

**You should never use basic authentication without HTTPS**

You can force HTTPS with:

```
public class RequireHttpsAttribute : AuthorizationFilterAttribute
{
 public override void OnAuthorization(HttpActionContext actionContext)
 {
 if (actionContext.Request.RequestUri.Scheme != Uri.UriSchemeHttps)
 {
 actionContext.Response = new HttpResponseMessage
 (System.Net.HttpStatusCode.Forbidden)
 {
 ReasonPhrase = "HTTPS Required"
 };
 }
 else
 {
 base.OnAuthorization(actionContext);
 }
 }
}
```

### Windows authentication

This is another option which is good for internal AD based systems and can allow single-sign-on, however it requires NTLM or Kerberos support and is a bad choice for consumer facing systems.

Server side, all you need to do is configure:

```
<system.web>
    <authentication mode="Windows" />
</system.web>
```

Modern browsers all support this, but if using a client app you can make a new `HttpHandlerClient` with `UseDefaultCredentials` set to true.

### Preventing CSRF

CSRF is just as much a problem with WebAPI as with MVC. You could make the following cookie check for a request cookie containing the antiforgery token:

```
CookieHeaderValue cookie = Request.Headers
 .GetCookies(AntiForgeryConfig.CookieName)
 .FirstOrDefault();
if (cookie == null) return;
Stream requestBufferedStream = Request.Content.ReadAsStreamAsync().Result;
requestBufferedStream.Position = 0;
NameValueCollection myform = Request.Content.ReadAsFormDataAsync().Result;
try
{
 AntiForgery.Validate(cookie[AntiForgeryConfig.CookieName].Value,
 myform[AntiForgeryConfig.CookieName]);
}
catch
{
 throw new HttpResponseException(
 new HttpResponseMessage(HttpStatusCode.Unauthorized));
}
```

### Implementing cross-domain requests (removed)

You can enable CORS in the web.config or via a nuget package which adds a new attribute `[EnableCors(origins: "http://www.somewhere.com", headers: "*", methods: "*")]`.

### Implementing and extending authorisation filters

There are a couple of classes related to authorisation that can be extended:

* `AuthorizeAttribute` - to perform logic based on the current user/roles
* `AuthorizeFilterAttribute` - to perform synchronous logic not necessarily based on the user
* `IAuthorizationFilter` - for async authorization logic - for async controllers

The default for AuthorizeAttribute is a whitelist - you could implement a blacklist by inheriting `AuthorizeAttribute` in a class and writing a `public bool IsAuthorized(HttpActionContext context)` method.


## Part 4 - Host and manage a web api

Like a WCF service, a web API needs to be hosted and this can be done through IIS, Azure, self-hosting, etc.

### Self hosting

You need a project template that makes an executable and implement a `HttpHostSelfConfiguration` class and a `HttpSelfHostServer`.

You also need the self hosting framework from NuGet.

An example as a console app:

```
class Program
{
 static void Main(string[] args)
 {
 Console.WriteLine("Starting Web API Server. Please wait...");
 if (typeof(MyWebApi.Controllers.ValuesController) == null)
 {
 // work-around to load assembly into memory (only needed if in a different project).
 return;
 }
 var hostConfig = new HttpSelfHostConfiguration("http://localhost:8080");

 //The hosting config would normally be added automatically in a web app but needs to be done manually, here
 hostConfig.Routes.MapHttpRoute("API Name", 
 "api/{controller}/{action}/{id}",
 new { id = RouteParameter.Optional });
 using (HttpSelfHostServer server = new HttpSelfHostServer(hostConfig))
 {
 server.OpenAsync().Wait();
 Console.WriteLine("Press [ENTER] to close");
 Console.ReadLine();
 server.CloseAsync().Wait();
 }
 }
}
```

### Hosting in IIS

This is quite simple - you only need to set up an application pool and then add the service as an app or virtual directory under an existing app.

### Hosting under Azure a worker role

You can host in azure under a worker role or even a VM, as a website or a cloud service.

You can have multitier architecture and have different components talk to each other through queues. The webAPI could be a web role with a worker role behind it.

Deploying to Azure is just as easy as deploying to IIS.

### Restricting message size

This is good for mitigating DoS attacks.

You can do this in code for self-hosted:

```
var config = new HttpSelfHostConfiguration(baseAddress);
config.MaxReceivedMessageSize = 1024;
config.MaxBufferSize = 1024;
```

Alternatively, you can do it via config for IIS: `<httpRuntime maxRequestLength="1024" />`

### Configuring the host for Streaming

To turn off buffering, you can set up a class inheriting from `WebHostBufferPolicySelector` to do it dynamically:

```
public class StreamingPolicySelector : WebHostBufferPolicySelector
{
 public override bool UseBufferedInputStream(object hostContext)
 {
 var context = hostContext as HttpContextBase;
 if (context == null) return true;
 return !string.Equals(
 context.Request.RequestContext.RouteData.Values["controller"].ToString(),
 "uploading",
 StringComparison.InvariantCultureIgnoreCase);
 }
}

...

config.Services.Replace(typeof(IHostBufferPolicySelector),
 new StreamingPolicySelector());
```

You also need to set the `maxAllowedContentLength` and `maxRequestLength` in the web.config:

```
<system.webServer>
  <security>
    <requestFiltering>
      <requestLimits maxAllowedContentLength="2147483648" />
    </requestFiltering>
  </security>
</system.webServer>
<system.web>
  <httpRuntime maxRequestLength="2097152" />
</system.web>
```

But for self hosting, it's either-or:

```
selfHostConf.TransferMode = TransferMode.StreamedRequest;  //responses only
selfHostConf.TransferMode = TransferMode.StreamedResponse; //both
selfHostConf.TransferMode = TransferMode.Streamed;
```

## Part 5 - Consume Web API Services

You can use `HttpClient` to programatically access a web api.

### Consuming web api Services

You can set up an HttpClient easily:

```
private const int port = 30930;
private HttpClient GetClient(string mediaType)
{
 String baseUri = @"http://localhost:" + port;
 HttpClient apiClient = new HttpClient();
 apiClient.BaseAddress = new Uri(baseUri);
 apiClient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Accept.Add(
 new MediaTypeWithQualityHeaderValue(mediaType));
 return apiClient;
}
```

You will receive data as JSON or XML so it is useful to reference or recreate the model classes.

### GetAsync -> HttpGet

There is only an async method defined in the client:

```
Task<HttpResponseMessage> GetResponse = client.GetAsync("api/values/1");

..or..

using (var client = GetClient("application/json"))
{
 HttpResponseMessage message = await client.GetAsync("/api/values/1");
 if (message.IsSuccessStatusCode)
 {
 Foo result = await message.Content.ReadAsAsync<Foo>();
 }
}
```

There are similar methods For

### HttpPost: PostAsync/PostAsJsonAsync

```
using (var client = GetClient("application/json"))
{
 var message = await client.PostAsJsonAsync<Foo>("api/values",
 new Foo
 {
 Value1 = "Bar",
 Value2 = 42
 });
}
```

### HttpPut: PutAsync/PutAsJsonAsync

```
using (var client = GetClient("application/json"))
{
 var message = await client.PutAsJsonAsync<Foo>("api/values",
 new Foo
 {
 Value1 = "Bar",
 Value2 = 42
 });
}
```

### HttpDelete: DeleteAsync

```
using (var client = GetClient("application/json"))
{
 message = await client.DeleteAsync("api/values/1);
}
```

### Exception handling

You can set up listeners for every different error code or just trap them all by setting `message.EnsureSuccessStatusCode()` which throws the errors for you:

```
try
{
 message = await client2.GetAsync("BadUri");
 message.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();
}
catch (HttpRequestException errorCode)
{
 Debug.WriteLine(errorCode.Message);
}
```

### Send/receive in different formats

You can accept many different formats from application/xml to text/html, image/png, application/json, etc.

In addition to the supplied support for JSON, XML and url-encoded form data, you can write your own by implementing MediaTypeFormatter or BufferedMediaTypeFormatter:

```
public class CustomerCsvFormatter : BufferedMediaTypeFormatter
{
 public class CustomerCsvFormatter()
 {
 SupportedMediaTypes.Add(new MediaTypeHeaderValue("text/csv");
 }
}

...

config.Formatters.Add(new CustomerCsvFormatter()); ```You need to override `CanWriteType`/`CanReadType` and implement `WriteToStream`/`ReadFromStream`.
