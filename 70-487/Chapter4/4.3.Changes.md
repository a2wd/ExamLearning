# Chapter 4

Changes and additions to 70-487

## Part 1

Design a Web API

### Design and Implement routes

The default MVC route is `{controller}/{action}/{id}` but the default WebAPI route is prefixed with api: `api/{controller}/{id}`


## Part 2

Implement a WebAPI

### Implement attribute routing

Attribute routing is good for routes that are harder with conventional web-api routing:

```
[Route("customers/{customerId}/orders")]
public IEnumerable<Order> GetOrdersByCustomer(int customerId) { ... }
```

To enable you need to call `config.MapHttpAttributeRoutes()` in the config section. This can be used in conjunction with `config.Routes.MapHttpRoute()`.

You can also have more than one parameter in the route. The `RoutePrefix` attribute lets you define a common route ie, /api, the ~ sign overrides the default:

```
[RoutePrefix("api/books")]
public class BooksController : ApiController
{
    // GET api/books
    [Route("")]
    public IEnumerable<Book> Get() { ... }

    // GET api/books/5
    [Route("{id:int}")]
    public Book Get(int id) { ... }

    // POST api/books
    [Route("")]
    public HttpResponseMessage Post(Book book) { ... }

	// GET /api/authors/1/books
    [Route("~/api/authors/{authorId:int}/books")]
    public IEnumerable<Book> GetByAuthor(int authorId) { ... }
}
```

You can also have parameters in the route prefix and can add constraints to parameters, such as `{customerId:int}`

You can even make your own constraints by implementing `IHttpRouteConstraint` and filling the `public bool Match()` method. You will need to register the constraint in `config.MapHttpAttributeRoutes(DefaultInlineConstraintResolver)`.

You can make parameters optional with a `?` and name routes for easier calling later:

```
  [Route("api/books/{id}", Name="GetBookById")]
    public BookDto GetBook(int id) {...}

	...somewhere else...

        // Generate a link to the new book and set the Location header in the response.
        string uri = Url.Link("GetBookById", new { id = book.BookId });
```

There is a `RouteOrder` parameter on the attribute to specify an order override, lower numbers are evaluated first and the default is 0.

### Implement SignalR

SignalR allows bi-directional communications and is based on websockets with a fallback to long-polling.

You can wire up signalR in the config section:

`app.MapSignalR()`

SignalR implementation involves hubs:

```
public abstract class ApiControllerWithHub<THub> : ApiController
    where THub : IHub
{
    Lazy<IHubContext> hub = new Lazy<IHubContext>(
        () => GlobalHost.ConnectionManager.GetHubContext<THub>()
    );

    protected IHubContext Hub
    {
        get { return hub.Value; }
    }
}
```

SignalR has a persistent connection which is good for sending/receiving strings. It also has the hubs for rpc (remote procedure call) style messages.

You can broadcast to all clients too.

```
var hub = $.connection.myHub
var result = hub.echo("string value") //assuming a server-side hub with an echo method
hub.tellAll("something else") //assuming a service-side hub with a tellAl() method
```

On the server you could call methods that would be defined on the hub client-side.

### Test webAPI services

You can unit test web api services, when setting up the test the controller must be configured with the request and configuration values:

```
[TestMethod]
public void GetReturnsProduct()
{
    // Arrange
    var controller = new ProductsController(repository);
    controller.Request = new HttpRequestMessage();
    controller.Configuration = new HttpConfiguration();

    // Act
    var response = controller.Get(10);

    // Assert
    Product product;
    Assert.IsTrue(response.TryGetContentValue<Product>(out product));
    Assert.AreEqual(10, product.Id);
}
```

## Part 3

Secure a Web api

**Enable cross-domain requests has been removed**

### (modified) Design, implement, and extend authorization and authentication filters to control access to the application

### Implement Cross Origin Request Sharing (CORS)

### Implement SSO by using OAuth 2.0

## Configure multiple authentication modes on a single endpoint
