# Chapter 4

Creating and consuming web API based services


## Part 1

Design a Web API

### Thought experiment

1. By using http verbs in method names, it helps make everything clearer to the end-user and to other programmers what different methods are doing.

2. Content negotiation is useful so that clients can declare the type of returned values they can accept in order for a service to be more utilitarian about it's data - compared to services, which are more likely to be consumed internally, a webAPI may be more likely consumed by regular internet users.

### Quiz

* 1.C/D HttpDelete and HttpPut, respectively, are for deleting and updating content.
* 2.C HttpPost allows form data to be submitted to a service.
* 3.D The `AcceptVerbs` attribute allows a method to be used for multiple actions


## Part 2

Implement a WebAPI

### Thought experiment

1. Web API is well suited to a multi-user, multi-device scenario because it serialises data in JSON and XML which are well-supported across different platforms and fairly universal. It easily allows for either app or web implementations.

2. Content negotiation may be useful to serialise data in a format more useful to the specific app. Dependency injection may be useful where different backend solutions are used. Action filters will probably have a place in the action methods and streaming could be useful for larger files like xrays and scans. HttpMessageHandler could also be useful here.

### Quiz

* 1.A/B Accept-header can be used for json or xml.
* 2.A/B/D - content negotiation works with accept, accept-charset and accept-language.
* 3.B/D to add a global attribute for exceptions, you need to add it to HttpConfiguration.Filters and inherit ExceptionFilterAttribute
