Deploying web application services

## Part 2

Choosing a deployment strategy

### Deploy apps using Azure Web Site

You can deploy with FTP, Kudu (via Git/Dropbox etc) or Web Deploy.

You can manually copy files to Azure via an FTP client such as FileZilla.

You can also deploy by syncing with a cloud folder such as OneDrive.

You can also continuously deploy such as with Github, enabling version rollback.

Using the aforementioned Kudu engine, you can also deploy from a local git. Via the Azure portal.

Finally you can deploy from Visual Studio (or other IDEs like Xcode, Eclipse, Azure SDK).

There are also command line tools like MSBuild or Powershell that can be used to automate deployment.
