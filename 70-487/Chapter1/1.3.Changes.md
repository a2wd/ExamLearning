### Azure Storage

Azure storage is scalable, cross platform, global accessible, load-balanced.

It has four options:

* Blob storage (aka Object storage) - text or binary data
* Table storage - NoSQL key-attribute store of structured dataset
* Queue storage - messaging for workflow processing & cloud service communications
* File storage - SMB access to files, REST API for on-prem access.

You can have general purpose accounts or blob storage accounts. Blobs are organised into containers for permissioning. Table stores are good for flexible, changing data sets. Messages in queue storage can be up to 64kb in size. File storage can be accessed via traditional IO file access.

Access to storage can be private to the account, permissioned with tokens (SAS - shared access signature) or be made public.

The data can be replicated a variety of ways. Locally-redundant, Zone-redundant, geo-redundant or read-access geo-redundant.

There are CLI tools and a library to get data in/out.
