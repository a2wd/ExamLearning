Accessing data

## Part 1

Choose data access technologies

### Thought experiment

1. For a legacy app being gradually exposed to external access, it would be advisable to move away from ADO.net

2. Using EF wouldn't of itself help with external access, but it would allow WCF which is based on EF.

3. Using WCF would provide an advantage over ADO.net in that it would allow for simpler and more compatible access to the app with JSON data and RESTful services.
