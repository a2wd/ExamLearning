Accessing data

## Part 1

Choose data access technologies

### Thought experiment

1. For a legacy app being gradually exposed to external access, it would be advisable to move away from ADO.net

2. Using EF wouldn't of itself help with external access, but it would allow WCF which is based on EF.

3. Using WCF would provide an advantage over ADO.net in that it would allow for simpler and more compatible access to the app with JSON data and RESTful services.

### Quiz

* 1.B to add a new property, you could add the field to the table and model and update the mapping
* 2.C/D The data services frameworks could expose application data for external consumption
* 3.C In an entity data model, the MSL file handles the mappings.


## Part 2

Implement caching

### Thought experiment

1. Data that doesn't change very often would be good for caching and data that is not critical.

2. When determining a caching strategy, you could consider the need for up-to-date information and the load experienced by providing different information dynamically as opposed to cached.

3. With regards data changes, it would be good to think about the need to check when the underlying data is modified or otherwise stale. CacheDependency objects can help monitor this.

### Quiz

* 1.A/B/D - FileChangeMonitor and SqlChangeMonitor are change monitors while CacheEntryChangeMonitor is a base class for these.
* 2.C System.Runtime.caching has a NotRemovable (or else, Default) attribute.
* 3.A/D There are many ways to add an item to a cache.
