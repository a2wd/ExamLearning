# Chapter 1

Accessing data

## Part 1

Choose data access technologies

### Thought experiment

1. For a legacy app being gradually exposed to external access, it would be advisable to move away from ADO.net

**Correct**

2. Using EF wouldn't of itself help with external access, but it would allow WCF which is based on EF.

**Correct and WCF allows OData**

3. Using WCF would provide an advantage over ADO.net in that it would allow for simpler and more compatible access to the app with JSON data and RESTful services.

**Correct**

### Quiz

* 1.B to add a new property, you could add the field to the table and model and update the mapping **A/B/C/D**
* 2.C/D The data services frameworks could expose application data for external consumption **C**
* 3.C In an entity data model, the MSL file handles the mappings. **D**


## Part 2

Implement caching

### Thought experiment

1. Data that doesn't change very often would be good for caching and data that is not critical.

**Correct**

2. When determining a caching strategy, you could consider the need for up-to-date information and the load experienced by providing different information dynamically as opposed to cached.

**Correct, but weigh up trip cost with data cost**

3. With regards data changes, it would be good to think about the need to check when the underlying data is modified or otherwise stale. CacheDependency objects can help monitor this.

**Correct**

### Quiz

* 1.A/B/D - FileChangeMonitor and SqlChangeMonitor are change monitors while CacheEntryChangeMonitor is a base class for these. **//Correct**
* 2.C System.Runtime.caching has a NotRemovable (or else, Default) attribute. **//Correct**
* 3.A/D There are many ways to add an item to a cache. **//Correct**


## Part 3

Implement transactions

### Thought experiment

1. An operation with different commands that need to happen together would make a good choice for transactions

**The more related items, the higher the change**

2. You might not make every operational transactional because of the extra memory requirements & overheads involved.

**Correct**

3. The transaction implementation would be guided by the application requirements and how data is read/written. Locks, isolation levels and priorities need to be considered.

**Correct**

### Quiz

* 1.B RepeatableReads is the isolation level that will avoid nonrepeatable reads but may still allow phantom data **B/D**
* 2.A/B both quick running queries on one table and long running queries on multiple tables could benefit from transactions **B**


## Part 4

Implement Data Storage in Windows Azure

### Thought experiment

1. For a video storage service, it would be good to consider blob storage while the advanced statistics could use table storage (or SQL if the data is structured).

**Correct**

2. You could use different storage options depending on the kind of data being stored, in this case very disparate types.

**Correct**

3. The video files could good candidate for a CDN, though the statistics might be likely to change and therefore likelier to become stale on a CDN.

**Correct**

### Quiz

* 1. A/B table storage and queue storage could be used for a chat room **A**
* 2. B/C the azure CDN improves data access for users further from the source and helps deal with spikes in demand **//Correct**
* 3. A. the vo.sitename.net url uses the CDN **//Correct**


## Part 5

Create and implement a WCF data service

### Thought experiment

1. It is possible to consume data via a URI based architecture with data-services by hooking up the models to a DataService with entityframework, or other methods.

**Correct**

2. Via this method, select, filtering, ordering and other basic querying operations are supported.

**Correct**

### Quiz

* 1.A/B QueryInterceptors and ChangeInterceptors can be set to run when querying data **B**
* 2.A the $filter=Id gt 5 could be used to retrieve items with an Id value greater than 5 **//Correct**
* 3.D $orderby orders and $filter colName gt x would filter on values greater than x in column 'colName' **//Correct**

## Part 6

Manipulate XML data structures

### Thought experiment

1. An application processing uniform, large XML documents might not be best served with LINQ-to-XML, although it would make it easier to manipulate, loops and regular XElement manipulation might be more performant.

**Correct**

2. To simplify consumption of the documents, an generic class could be created to make a general case for the similar aspects of the documents.

**Correct, although should specify use of class - an immediate transform on the documents**

### Quiz

* 1.D you can manually escape special characters, use XElement or XmlConvert.Encode **//Correct**
* 2.A In XML, every element must have a closing element. **//Correct**
