Query/Manipulate data with EF

### Async operations in EF

You can use the `context.SaveChangesAsync()` to asynchronously save changes.

You can use an await in a linq statement:

```
var blogs = await (from b in db.Blogs
                    orderby b.Name
                    select b).ToListAsync()

```

This must happen in an `async` method.

### Mapping stored procs

You can map stored procedures via the entity designer.

Use the **mapping details** > **select insert function**

You can use this to map entity types to the stores proc.
