Querying and manipulating data with EntityFramework

## Part 1

Query/Manipulate data with EF

### Thought experiment

1. For a structure with a parent, five related children one of which with two grandchildren, it may be preferrable to lazy load the data, but the ultimate decision is going to rest on the size of that data compared to the number of possible roundtrips.

2. If you pull back all the data, you have space considerations to take into account.

3. If you lazy-load the data, you have network latency to consider.

4. The best approach will be determined by the level of knowledge about what you will do with the data - if a known number of queries will be required, then it could be better to load all at once, but if an unknown number, it could be better to lazy-load.

### Quiz
