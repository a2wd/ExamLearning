Thought experiments and quizzes


## Part 1

Program flow

### Thought experiment

1. A `for` loop is better than a `while` loop when iterating over object properties such as a dictionary or an array

2. The readability of code is affected by the incrementing code being shown alongside the loop condition.

### Quiz

* C. `for` provides iterative flow control
* A. join and D. concat are both methods to combine arrays
* C. `do..while` will ensure that a loop is run at least once
* B. `break` can be used to exit a loop


## Part 2

All about events

### Thought experiment
To change fields in a form when other fields are changed, the onchange event could be used. Alternatively for text inputs, onkeypress could be used. Another alternative would be the onblur event which would ensure the user has finished interacting with the element, but could lead to UI problems if elements update while they already have focus.

### Quiz

* B. CSS is not a valid method of setting events
* B. Anonymous functions *do not* have a clearly defined name
* A. `window.event.returnValue = false` would cancel an event (as would B. `return false;`).
* D. mouseleave occurs when a DOM element receives mouse focus (but not on the element receiving focus).
* A. dragstart, drag, dragenter, drop is the correct order of events for a drag action
