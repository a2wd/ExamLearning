# Chapter 2 - Program Flow

Program flow means presenting functions in a proper order. This can mean:

* Conditional flow (if...then)
* Iterative flow (for...each)
* Behaviour flow (onclick)

and... **exception handling**


## Part 1 - Implement flow

`if...else`, `switch...case` and `ternary (?, :)` operators

Must be able to use evaluation operators (`>`, `!=`, etc).

Don't forget about the `==` which doesn't check for data-type equality and `===` which does (as per `!=`/`!==`).

Control statements can be nested.

The logical or is a shortcutting operator.
