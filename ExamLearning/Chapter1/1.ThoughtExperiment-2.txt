Creating a game

A ball could be animated from one side of the screen to the other with a javascript loop, in canvas by
refreshing the drawing surface before rendering each frame, a setTimeout loop could be used to manage 
the frames and a seperate object could be used to keep track of the current position of the ball.

A similar approach could be taken with SVG, though the position of the ball vector could be tracked via
an object with a DOM reference to the image.

In terms of performance, if many balls need to be animated, the former canvas approach would be better
as SVG would not be as performant as the number of items animated increases greatly.

//Solutions point to canvas as more performant
