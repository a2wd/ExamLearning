User input & validation

## Part 1

HTML5 Inputs

### Thought experiment

Building on the problems from part 1.3, it would be possible to use features such as the pattern attribute for validation
such that when a user progresses through a form the correct validations are presented for different elements such as telephone
numbers and addresses/post codes.

**//Average**

### Quiz

* C. the checkbox allows users to make multiple selections **//correct**
* D. the password input allows for secure data-input **//correct**
* B. The submit control posts data to the server **//correct**
* D. the `readonly` attribute stops a user from editing the data **//errata - not answered**
* C. a required attribute prompts the user to enter values for an input element (A. javascript could be used, too) **//correct**


## Part 2

Javascript Input Validation

### Thought experiment

Additional security techniques that could be added to a webpage to prevent XSS could include anti-forgery tokens
and sanitation of all input.

**//Answer not as deep, restricted to types of validation and uses**

### Quiz

* A. $ denotes the end of a string in regex  **//correct**
* D. allow-top-navigation allows an iframe to load content from the containing HTML document **//correct**
* C. eval should never be used to run JavaScript **//correct**


## Part 3

Consuming Data with Javascript

### Thought experiment

To get data from a stock ticker, you could use AJAX requests with an interval (via setInterval) to update the value reqgularly.

**//correct**

### Quiz

* D. a valid JSON string must feature comma-seperated key-value pairs. **//correct**
* C. responseText provides an XMLHttpRequest in a human-readable form **//correct**
* D. User credentials are sent to the server in response to a security response **//correct**


## Part 4

Seralisation of data

### Thought experiment

The form from part 1 could be extended to use the XMLHttpRequest object by overriding the submit click handler and 
using the jQuery form serialize method. If the email address needs to be validated against a live database, then at
this stage, a synchronous XMLHttpRequest could be sent to the server with the entered email and the response checked
for duplication, a message being shown and submission cancelled if that is the case.

 **//correct, but neglected to mention adding this code to the onblur of the email input box**

### Quiz

* C. JSON.parse is the method for parsing a valid JSON string to an object **//correct**
* D. request.responseType = 'blob' allows for binary data **//correct**
* B. it is possible to control what's sent to the server by handling the submit event of a form **//correct**
