Part 1 - HTML5 Semantics
========================
Use header and footer elements to contain top/bottom content

The nav element can be used for navigation

The hgroup element can contain headers

Articles group independent sections of content like individual blog posts

Sections denote different parts of a page and can be grouped under articles

Asides can be used to show relevant information, but not directly related to the current section

figure and figcaption can be used to show figures and related captions

A progress element can have a value and max attributes and is used to show progress
Omitting the value from a progress can indicate an indeterminate progress bar

The mark element is used to mark specific content

div element is still in use!

html5 can affect both seo and screen readers

Part 2 - DOM Manipulation
=========================

We can access the dom with the following functions of document:

getElementById
getElementsByClassName
getElementsByTagName
querySelector
querySelectorAll

The following functions of a dom node

childNodes
firstChild
lastChild
hasChildNodes

After adding objects, we can remove them with:

removeChild
removeNode
replaceNode //IE Only
replaceChild //as in node.replaceChild(newChild, oldChild)


Multimedia
----------
The `<video>` tag allows us to show videos and can have various source parameters
Allowed attributes include autoplay, controls, loop and poster

A reference to the video object in javascript can be used to play, pause and scrub the file

play()
pause()
volume
currentTime

The `<audio>` element has similar functionality

The `<canvas>` element allows 2d drawings at a pixel-level, the getContext() method of a canvas object
exposes the following methods:

beginPath
moveTo
lineTo
stroke

There are also curve functions:

arc
quadraticCurveTo
bezierCurveTo

You can call beginPath to start a new line or just closePath to close the last one.

There is also a rect method to draw rectangles and fill/gradient methods to add fills to paths:

rect()
fillRect()
fill()
createLinearGradient
createRadialGradient

Further, the stroke style can be set to an `Image()`

Text can be added with the `strokeText` command

SVG can be used to draw and manipulate vector graphics dynamically
