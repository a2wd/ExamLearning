# Chapter 4 :: CSS3

Styling HTML5 with advanced CSS3

## Part 1 - CSS text properties

Text can be coloured with colour-names, hex or rgb()

font-weight can bold text. Values (100...) or names (bold) cn be used

the font-style can set italics.

`@font-face()` can be used to import other font faces.

```
@font-face {
   font-family: "My Nicer Font";
   src: url('fonts/my_woff_font.eot');
   src: url('fonts/my_woff_font.woff');
}
```

Then the font-family of an element is set to the specified font-family in the font-face declaration.

The font-size can set the pixel, em, rem, percentage or name (small, large...) of a font's size.

The alignement can be set with text-align (left, right, center, justify)

text-indentation sets indentation.

letter-spacing and word-spacing set the spacing on these relative parts of text.

hyphen can be used to set whether breaks are hyphenating `none`, `Auto` or `Manual` (with `&shy;`)

There's also text-drop-shadow.


## Part 2 - Styling boxes

Boxes have `width` and `height` attributes (can be precentages, rem, pixels, etc.)

A `border-style`, `border-color` can be set.

`border-spacing` defines spacing between adjacent elements. Also, `border-width` for thickness.

The `border: 5px solid black;` short-hand can also be used.

The individual borders (top, left, bottom, etc). can be set independently.

Padding & margin are also available as combined, shorthand, individual, separate values.

Opacity allows for transparent elements.

A `background-image: url(...)` can be set with a size, repeat, clip and position.

There are linear gradients and radial gradients.

`background: linear-gradient(black, blue)`

This takes an angle and a series of colour stops.

The `box-shadow` allows for adding a shadow with the following parameters:

* `h-shadow`, `v-shadow` - horizontal/vertical position
* `blur` - optional, defaults to 0, distance of blur
* `spread` - shadow size
* `color`
* `inset` - inside the box?

The shadow position (h- & v-shadow) can be negative values to move the shadow to the top/left of the box.

`Text-shadow` has similar properties to box shadows.

Clipping: `clip: rect(x0, y0, x1, y1)` allows you to hide parts of an element, the element must be `fixed` or `absolute`

**All elements are placed relative to their parents, by default**

We can `position` an element relative to the page `fixed`, it's normal flow `relative` or it's parent `absolute`.

**Left and right measure from the outer edge of a box *including* margins and borders.**

`z-index` allows you to position absolute elements in-front or behind other elements.


## Part 3 - Flexible content
