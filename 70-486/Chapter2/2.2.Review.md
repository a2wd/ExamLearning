Chapter 2 - Design the UI

## Part 1

Apply the UI

### Thought Experiment

1. With a music website portal, sections of the website could be made dynamic and personalised for each user by using partial views for those section, serving different content for that view, depending on the user.

2. Knowing that a significant portion of the visitors don't have HTML5 compliant browsers would lead to advising the design not to include HTML5 elements such as `<section>`, `<header>` and `<nav>`, where possible.

### Quiz

* 1.A/C Any parts of the design that will appear on every page are a good candidate for including in the master template.
* 2.C to design a consistent interface, common elements should have the same style.
* 3.B/D dynamically pulling in information from a database and customising the interface to for different users are good reasons to switch to dynamic web content


## Part 2

Design the UI behaviour

### Thought Experiment

1. Validation via annotation attribuates on the data-model could stop a user from entering incorrect dates, when paired with an `EditorFor` and `ValidationMessageFor` html helpers. Regex validation coud be used to ensure a date is entered.

2. Information could be preloaded for display with the jQuery `load` function. This will ensure a snappy responsive UI.

3. When querying for a product, part of the screen could be updated with an AJAX call.

### Quiz

* 1.C Contains both the text box and validation message HTML helpers
* 2.B It is possible to use AJAX to make regular async calls to the server for info as well as for saving objects from the client
* 3.A/B/D any system where there could be restrictions on types, required fields or field lengths are good candidates for validation.
