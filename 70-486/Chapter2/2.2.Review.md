Chapter 2 - Design the UI

## Part 1

Apply the UI

### Thought Experiment

1. With a music website portal, sections of the website could be made dynamic and personalised for each user by using partial views for those section, serving different content for that view, depending on the user.

2. Knowing that a significant portion of the visitors don't have HTML5 compliant browsers would lead to advising the design not to include HTML5 elements such as `<section>`, `<header>` and `<nav>`, where possible.

### Quiz

* 1.A/C Any parts of the design that will appear on every page are a good candidate for including in the master template.
* 2.C to design a consistent interface, common elements should have the same style.
* 3.B/D dynamically pulling in information from a database and customising the interface to for different users are good reasons to switch to dynamic web content
