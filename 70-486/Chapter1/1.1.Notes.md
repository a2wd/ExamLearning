# Chapter 1 - Design the application architecture

## Part 1 - Plan the application layers

An application is one or more related features, these are built up in *layers* of code.

MVC (model-view-controller) is about seperating different bits of the architecture - SoC (seperation of concerns).

* **Model** is business logic
* **View** is what a user sees
* **Controller** is the code that manages the two

### Planning data access

Data is key to designing an app. You can access it with an ORM (object relational mapper) or by rolling your own code.

The three main methods of developing the database are:

* **Model-first**, by using visual modelling & design tools
* **Code-first**, by building POCO (plain old CLR objects) from which a generator builds the db
* **Database-first**, by directly writing a schema. Best for updates/updgrades

If using entity framework to manage the DB access, extra code needs to be added - either in the controller or as an extra layer.

The **repository pattern** is a fancy way of talking about this abstraction and is a way of improving unit testing by further seperating the DB from the code.
