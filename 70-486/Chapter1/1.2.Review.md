Chapter 1: Design the application architecture

## Part 1

Plan the application layers

### Thought experiment

Implementing a government website:

1. To maintain the look and feel of a website across a new application, the site's existing design (HTML/CSS) could be retained by keeping the stylesheets and porting the HTML to the main layout and the views.

2. To enable real-time access to the data, the submitted forms could be passed into a database and exposed via a read-only view, optionally with secure access and a 'latest' feed/listing.

3. You could create and manage a separate business layer for this with entity framework or a custom class, to manage the data.

### Quiz

* 1.A When dealing with data from a third party provider, you could design a model to handle that data and create an asynchronous partial view to retrieve the data.
* 2.C To implement a dashboard page with combined data, it would be best to create a model for the summary data, handling the requests and merging of data in the model.
* 3.C/D When upgrading a legacy system with developers unfamiliar with OOP patterns, you could opt for a model-first or database-first schema design process.
* 4.C When designing a system with a high likelihood of system changes, you could implement the repository pattern, with the old system as one such repository and the new system(s) as subsequent repositories, when they become available.
