Chapter 1: Design the application architecture

## Part 1

Plan the application layers

### Thought experiment

Implementing a government website:

1. To maintain the look and feel of a website across a new application, the site's existing design (HTML/CSS) could be retained by keeping the stylesheets and porting the HTML to the main layout and the views.

2. To enable real-time access to the data, the submitted forms could be passed into a database and exposed via a read-only view, optionally with secure access and a 'latest' feed/listing.

3. You could create and manage a separate business layer for this with entity framework or a custom class, to manage the data.

### Quiz

* 1.A When dealing with data from a third party provider, you could design a model to handle that data and create an asynchronous partial view to retrieve the data.
* 2.C To implement a dashboard page with combined data, it would be best to create a model for the summary data, handling the requests and merging of data in the model.
* 3.C/D When upgrading a legacy system with developers unfamiliar with OOP patterns, you could opt for a model-first or database-first schema design process.
* 4.C When designing a system with a high likelihood of system changes, you could implement the repository pattern, with the old system as one such repository and the new system(s) as subsequent repositories, when they become available.

## Part 2

Distributed apps

### Thought experiment

A geographically distributed application:

1. Software in different regions could set up services such as REST services with an WebAPI to expose local data in those regions as JSON/XML that could be consumed and provided to users via a central app.

2. The primary concerns of an ASP.NET MVC app that would consume such disparate sources of data would be security, consistency, concurrency and availability. It would need to handle some regions 'going down' and user authentication.

3. The benefit of adding AppFabric would be that it provides a service bus that could help distribute the service requests automatically.

### Quiz

* 1.B/C a REST URL with XML could be exposed with the WebAPI ApiController, or by serialising the data manually in an MVC4 project.
* 2.B Traditionally consuming an ASMX web service would require adding a service reference.
* 3.C/D Hybrid apps are such where part of the solution is cloud based and part is hosted locally.
