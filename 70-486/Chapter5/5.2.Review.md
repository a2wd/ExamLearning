Chapter 5 - Design and implement security

## Part 1

Configure authentication

### Thought experiment

1. To authenticate an app against an existing database, you could use the forms authentication and set up the authentication to use the pre-existing database

2. If the existing database is never grandfathered, this is a good solution as no changes are necessary.

3. If the existing database is in an old application, then support could be ended for it and as standards change, it may become obsolete.

### Quiz

* 1.B Digest credentials are hashed and checked against the local store or domain
* 2.A FormsAuthentication.SetAuthCookie allows you to set the credentials cookie
