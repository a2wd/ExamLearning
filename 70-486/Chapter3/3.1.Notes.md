# Chapter 3 - Develop the UX

A good UX can make a website feel responsive, snappy and reduce clicks required. It's just as important as UI.

## Part 1 - SEO and Accessibility

SEO affects a page's rank on search engines. SEO has to do with content and structure - the structure also affects the accessibility of a site.

AJAX/jQuery can hide content - WAI-ARIA (web accessibility initiative - accessible rich internet applications) is a set of practices to help.

There are tools to check the HTML - The SEO toolkit under IIS, for instance. It can inform on broken links, missing tags or alt-properties, etc.

There are also Bing and Google webmaster tools. The W3C has stylesheet and HTML validators, which don't specifically look for SEO items but can help.

There is also the Page Inspector in Visual Studio.

Seperation of concerns also improves accessibility by having less to parse.

**Browser Developer Tools** are usefule when analysing the site structure and can be used to modify CSS, check for empty tags etc.

**WAI-ARIA** is good but increases payload size and not every browser supports it. Aria has:

* `aria-xyz` values such as `aria-pressed`
* `role="button"` and similar

There are also *landmark roles* such as:

* application
* button
* form
* main
* navigation

Some match HTML5 elements (like `<main>`). You can also build html-helpers to include aria support.
