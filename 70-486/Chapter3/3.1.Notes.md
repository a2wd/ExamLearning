# Chapter 3 - Develop the UX

A good UX can make a website feel responsive, snappy and reduce clicks required. It's just as important as UI.

## Part 1 - SEO and Accessibility

SEO affects a page's rank on search engines. SEO has to do with content and structure - the structure also affects the accessibility of a site.

AJAX/jQuery can hide content - WAI-ARIA (web accessibility initiative - accessible rich internet applications) is a set of practices to help.

There are tools to check the HTML - The SEO toolkit under IIS, for instance. It can inform on broken links, missing tags or alt-properties, etc.

There are also Bing and Google webmaster tools. The W3C has stylesheet and HTML validators, which don't specifically look for SEO items but can help.

There is also the Page Inspector in Visual Studio.

Seperation of concerns also improves accessibility by having less to parse.

**Browser Developer Tools** are usefule when analysing the site structure and can be used to modify CSS, check for empty tags etc.

**WAI-ARIA** is good but increases payload size and not every browser supports it. Aria has:

* `aria-xyz` values such as `aria-pressed`
* `role="button"` and similar

There are also *landmark roles* such as:

* application
* button
* form
* main
* navigation

Some match HTML5 elements (like `<main>`). You can also build html-helpers to include aria support.


## Part 2 - Globalisation & localisation (g12n & l10n)

g12n is the process of making an app usable by multiple cultures. It's broken down into l10n and i18n. It consists of translating labels & content, docs, help, etc. It consists of:

1. Translate files
2. Read browser's culture
3. Provide translated files

The server culture is the default.

l10n has language-locale, as in en-GB or en-US, same language different locale.

When making a request, the browser may specify language as part of the headers:

```
GET http://localhost/HTTP/1.1
Connection: keep-alive
Cache-Control: max-age=0
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.8
```

To automatically serve culture-dependent files, you need to add the following line to the **web.Config**:

`<globalization culture="auto" uiculture="auto" enableclientbasedculture="true" />`

The translated text, images & videos are put into *Resource* .xml files which are called via the `ResourceManager` class.

You can also localise individual views, useful for RTL languages like Arabic, or longer languages like German (30% longer on average).

Resource files can also be one-large or many-small ones.

In translating, you can make a dev-file with **@@-** prefixed values to indicate what has been translated. Also, some JavaScript or CSS (`content` attribute) may contain untranslated values.

### JavaScript g12n

Microsoft developed the jQuery plugin `jquery.globalize` to help and `globalize.cultures.js` with 305 translations.

You can check language with: `var language = "@Request.UserLanguages[0]"`

Or set it in jQuery with: `jQuery.preferCulture(lang)` and globally: `$.global.preferCulture(lang)`

It is good to offer users a culture override via a dropdown list and it can be set via:

`Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentUICulture = new CultureInfo("es-MX");`

Resource files that are too big can be split into individual satellite assemblies and compiled from the CLI. They should be named **resource_name.culture_identifier.resource** and can't contain executable code. You then load them into memory when needed with the ResourceManager.
