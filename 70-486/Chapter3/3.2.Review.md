Chapter 3 - Design the UX

## Part 1

SEO & Accessibility

### Thought experiment

1. You could use a variety of tools to detect major errors in your site - the SEO toolkit in IIS is one such example there are also HTML validators from the W3C and a variety of webmasters toolkits.

**Correct**

2. Implementing ARIA in your application would improve your search engine ranking.

**Correct**

3. You can check how different parts of a site download from the Network tab of a Browser's developer tools.

**Correct**

### Quiz

* 1.B Content hidden in JavaScript could hinder a site's SEO performance **//correct**
* 2.A/B/C The IIS SEO Toolkit, F12 Devtools and Bing Webmaster toolkit could all help investigate an application. **//B - a/c require server access**
* 3.B/D To estimate time taken to upgrade an application for WAI-ARIA standards you would need to consider HTML helpers and the complexity of the forms. **//correct**

## Part 2

Globalisation & localisation

### Thought experiment

1. For an application with the same language direction (LTR), it is easiest to maintain different resource files only.

**correct**

2. Using an AJAX UI might mean some text which needs translating is held in JavaScript. It could be translated with the jquery.globalization plugin.

**correct**

### Quiz

* 1.A/D Menu images and button tooltips are both candidates for translation **//correct**
* 2.A The resources manager provides translated strings **//correct**
* 3.D al.exe is the CLI app for building satellite assemblies. **//correct**


## Part 3

Controllers & Actions

### Thought experiment

1. In a role-based-permissions site, if you add authorisation with filters, then you might prevent non-logged in users from seeing the same pages. You could still track logged in users such as in the pipeline with a module and present the same views to all users.

**More info on how to use a controller to authenticate a user**

2. You could prevent unauthorised users from editing a site by adding Authorization filters with role checks to edit actions in the controller.

**correct**

3. If you are unable to create new content in a site while logged in, you may have set the wrong filters on the create action in the relevant controller.

**The model state needs validation on return**

### Quiz

* 1.B When authorising and using HTTPS, check the HTTPS first. **//correct**
* 2.A A fileresult is useful for transmitting binary files. **//correct**
* 3.D You could use different model binders in different views when supporting mixed types of data. **//correct**

## Part 4

Routes

### Thought experiment

1. You could modify a sales & customer facing site by seperating each business function into a different area with it's own set of Views/Controllers/Models.

**correct**

2. If a product is no longer available, you could cause a request to it to be redirected to the main page by adding a default route or optional parameters and using those to redirect the request from the controller action.

**correct**

3. You can modify the site to display different actionMethods for different URLs by adding extra routes in the routing table.

**correct, though should have noted that the same controller can be mapped to different routes**

### Quiz

* 1.B Help/Remote as a route with a controller of "support" and the action "index" would redirect that route to the support index. **//correct**
* 2.B route.IgnoreRoute can be used to ignore routes **//correct**
* 3.B/C if a set of controllers are too bloated, you could move them into their own *Area*. **A/C**


## Part 5

Extensibility

### Thought experiment

1. You could create and test a site theme without taking the site down by writing new css and implementing a filter to only display that theme to users with a certain authorisation level.

**You could use a custom view engine**

2. You could modify a controller's actions with custom IActionFilters to log when that action(s) are executed.

**correct, though also note the OnActionExecuting method**

3. If you want to display a specific result set and have already modified a controller to return that data, you could check that the route is not being overridden to display different data.

**correct**

### Quiz

* 1.D To send an email to logged-in users, you could create an ActionFilter and apply it to the login controller. **//correct**
* 2.A/B (same) logging data is possible via a globally-applied ActionFilter. **A/C**
* 3.B/C To store multi-part values consistently, you could apply business logic to the model or create a custom binder. **B/D**

## Part 6

Reduce bandwidth

### Thought experiment

1. To determine how long a file is taking to download, you can use a proxy such as Telerik Fiddler or the browser's network section of the dev-tools.

**correct**

2. To make the site load faster, you could enable bundling & minification, turn on GZIP and even specially process larger files.

**correct**

3. You could improve performance with a CDN by using it to transmit large files - you could check the throughput and the availability of servers in regions where you have the most users.

**correct**

### Quiz

* 1.A/B/C to improve performance on a site you could compress scripts locally or in IIS. **Just C**
* 2.B/D bundling is good but if filesize is too big, concurrent downloading might be preferable. **//correct**
* 3.B/C both adding content to a CDN and compressing files could help improve performance for remote users. **//correct**
