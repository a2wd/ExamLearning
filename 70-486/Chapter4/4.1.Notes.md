# Chapter 4 - Troubleshoot & debugging

Tracing & debugging from within Visual Studio

## Part 1 - Preventing/troubleshooting runtime issues

Thrown exceptions are obvious but there are also tools for tracing, logging and diagnostics.

There are many places problems can occur, there are also many tools to diagnose this.

**Performance wizard** allows you to moniter an app's performance. Profiling lets you analyse a running program:

* CPU sampling - lightweight check
* Instrumentation - adds code to all assemblies and times methods & calls
* .net memory allocation (sampling) - check for memory waste, lightweight or with instrumentation
* resource contention data (concurrency) - good for multithreaded apps

A good way to do this is to run a report, make changes and run a new report to compare.

**Visual studio profiler** is a tool that performs a complete trace of calls that happen in an app. It profiles method calls, created types, time spent, etc. There is a *hot path* tool that shows the most intesive flow-route of an app.

**Performance monitor** (`> perfmon`, from the command-line) is a built-in tool for monitoring performance. You can watch details for processes and apps. You can check requests, caches & app errors. You can schedule perfmon.

**Security issues** are usually related to authentication & authorisation. To troubleshoot, check how broad the issue is (users/roles). If for all, could be IIS but if only some, could be the authentication system.

**Tracing, logging & debugging** - logging is saving information. Tracing is analysing the program while running, debugging is analysing from various tools. **NLog** & **log4net** are open source logging tools.

Tracing is built into .net via `System.Diagnostics.TraceListeners` and can be configured via a web.config file. They can write trace info to a DB or file. This is done in code via `Trace.WriteLine("xyz")`. Trace messages can have a level (warn/info/error).
